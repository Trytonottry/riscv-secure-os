# RISC-V Secure Operating System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a secure operating system for RISC-V architecture, focusing on robust security features and minimal attack surface.

## Project Structure
- `bootloader/`: Contains the bootloader code.
- `kernel/`: Contains the kernel code.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for building and testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- RISC-V cross-compiler toolchain
- QEMU for RISC-V emulation

### Building the Bootloader
```bash
cd bootloader
make
